## üß† Purpose

This lab is designed to:
- Build a deep mathematical foundation for quantitative finance
- Explore, simulate, and model stochastic processes and trading strategies
- Develop production-grade research tooling using Python and Jupyter
- Package research ideas into modular, reusable components
- Serve as a personal quant portfolio and proof of work
